# Playground Space
## What is this?
 A playground space that I use for, really, anything that comes out of my mind
## Who inspired you to do this?
 Someone named [Tienne_k](https://www.youtube.com/@tienne_k77), made a video about tutorial, mentioned about something called "Playground Space"

 Anything in here might not look good, but at least I can look back on it in someway
 
 Here's the video: ['Tutorial hell' and the mindset of learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y-95ZB32dQ)
## What are inside of here?
 Programs, artworks, text files, documents, anything that I can probably still show to the public. Experiments, trial and errors, well, yeah.
## Can I take these files and share them?
 I'd prefer if you **don't**, you can use it as a reference but I don't want you to just take it and share it, maybe share some critisism or great amount of modification to improve it in someway and do credit me, and yourself if you've put some hardworking stuff on it.
